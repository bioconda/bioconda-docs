# Bioconda documentation

This repository stores the source code for the bioconda docs at
https://bioconda.github.io.

When pull requests are merged in to the main branch, the docs are built and
pushed to the [bioconda.github.io
repo](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda.github.io) for public hosting.

Note that prior to 2023-02-28, this documentation source was in the
[bioconda-utils](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils) repo, but was
split out for simplicity.
